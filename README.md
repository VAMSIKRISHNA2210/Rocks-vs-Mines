# Rocks-vs-Mines (Data Exploration with Matplotlib)
Developing a machine learning model that can accurately classify sonar signals as either "mines" or "rocks." The dataset provided contains sonar readings that have been processed to extract various features, and each reading is labeled as either a mine or a rock.

# Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of a collection of sonar readings taken from an underwater environment. Each sonar reading is represented as a set of numerical features that capture different characteristics of the object being detected.

The dataset contains the following columns:
The dataset contains sonar readings taken from an underwater environment.

Each sonar reading is represented as a set of numerical features.

The features capture various characteristics of the object being detected by the sonar.

The dataset includes multiple feature columns, labeled as Feature_1, Feature_2, ..., Feature_n.

Each feature column contains numeric values.

The dataset also includes a target column called "Label" that indicates whether the sonar reading corresponds to a "mine" or a "rock."

The Label column contains binary values, where 0 represents a rock and 1 represents a mine.

The goal is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify new sonar readings as either mines or rocks based on their extracted features.

The dataset may require preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, feature selection, and engineering before training the model.

### Label: 
A binary label indicating whether the sonar reading corresponds to a "mine" or a "rock" (0 for rock, 1 for mine).
train a machine learning model using this dataset to accurately classify new sonar readings as either mines or rocks based on their extracted features.
